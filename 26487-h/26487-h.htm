<h2>LITTLE LUCY'S WONDERFUL GLOBE.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>MOTHER BUNCH.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a wonderful fortnight in
little Lucy's life. One evening she went to
bed very tired and cross and hot, and in the
morning when she looked at her arms and legs
they were all covered with red spots, rather
pretty to look at, only they were dry and
prickly.</p>

<p>Nurse was frightened when she looked at
them. She turned all the little sisters out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the night nursery, covered Lucy up close, and
ordered her not to stir, certainly not to go into
her bath. Then there was a whispering and a
running about, and Lucy was half alarmed, but
more pleased at being so important, for she did
not feel at all ill, and quite enjoyed the tea
and toast that Nurse brought up to her. Just
as she was beginning to think it rather tiresome
to lie there with nothing to do, except to watch
the flies buzzing about, there was a step on the
stairs and up came the doctor. He was an old
friend, very good-natured, and he made fun with
Lucy about having turned into a spotted leopard,
just like the cowry shell on Mrs. Bunker's
mantelpiece. Indeed, he said he thought she
was such a curiosity that Mrs. Bunker would
come for her and set her up in the museum,
and then he went away. Suppose, oh, suppose
she did!</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker, or Mother Bunch, as Lucy and
her brothers and sisters called her, was housekeeper
to their Uncle Joseph. He was really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
their great uncle, and they thought him any
age you can imagine. They would not have
been much surprised to hear that he had sailed
with Christopher Columbus, though he was a
strong, hale, active man, much less easily tired
than their own papa. He had been a ship's
surgeon in his younger days, and had sailed all
over the world, and collected all sorts of curious
things, besides which he was a very wise and
learned man, and had made some great discovery.
It was <i>not</i> America. Lucy knew that
her elder brother understood what it was, but
it was not worth troubling her head about, only
somehow it made ships go safer, and so he
had had a pension given him as a reward; and
had come home and bought a house about a
mile out of the town, and built up a high room
to look at the stars from with his telescope, and
another to try his experiments in, and a long
one besides for his museum; yet, after all, he
was not much there, for whenever there was
anything wonderful to be seen, he always went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
off to look at it and; whenever there was a
meeting of learned men&mdash;scientific men was the
right word&mdash;they always wanted him to help
them make speeches and show wonders. He
was away now: he had gone away to wear a
red cross on his arm, and help to take care of
the wounded in the sad war between the French
and Germans.</p>

<p>But he had left Mother Bunch behind him.
Nobody knew exactly what was Mrs. Bunker's
nation, indeed she could hardly be said to have
had any, for she had been born at sea, and had
been a sailor's wife; but whether she was mostly
English, Dutch, or Danish, nobody knew and
nobody cared. Her husband had been lost at
sea, and Uncle Joseph had taken her to look
after his house, and always said she was the
only woman who had sense and discretion
enough ever to go into his laboratory or dust
his museum.</p>

<p>She was very kind and good-natured, and
there was nothing that the children liked better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
than a walk to Uncle Joseph's, and, after a
game at play in the garden, a tea-drinking with
her&mdash;such quantities of sugar! such curious cakes
made in the fashion of different countries! such
funny preserves from all parts of the world!
and more delightful to people who considered
that looking and hearing was better sport than
eating, and that the tongue is not <i>only</i> meant
to taste with, such cupboards and drawers full
of wonderful things, such stories about them!
The lesser ones liked Mrs. Bunker's room better
than Uncle Joseph's museum, where there were
some big stuffed beasts with glaring eyes that
frightened them, and they had to walk round
with hands behind, that they might not touch
anything, or else their uncle's voice was sure
to call out gruffly, "Paws off!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker was not a bit like the smart
housekeepers at other houses. To be sure, on
Sundays she came out in a black silk gown
with a little flounce at the bottom, a scarlet
China crape shawl with a blue dragon upon it&mdash;his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
wings over her back, and a claw over
each shoulder, so that whoever sat behind her
in church was terribly distracted by trying to
see the rest of him&mdash;and a very big yellow
Tuscan bonnet, trimmed with sailor's blue ribbon;
but in the week and about the house she wore
a green stuff, with a brown holland apron and
bib over it, quite straight all the way down, for
she had no particular waist, and her hair, which
was of a funny kind of flaxen grey, she bundled
up and tied round, without any cap or anything
else on her head. One of the little boys had
once called her Mother Bunch, because of her
stories; and the name fitted her so well that
the whole family, and even her master, took
it up.</p>

<p>Lucy was very fond of her; but when about
an hour after the doctor's visit she was waked
by a rustling and a lumbering on the stairs, and
presently the door opened, and the second best big
bonnet&mdash;the go-to-market bonnet with the turned
ribbons&mdash;came into the room with Mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Bunch's face under it, and the good-natured voice
told her she was to be carried to Uncle Joseph's
and have oranges and tamarinds, she did begin
to feel like the spotted cowry, to think about
being set on the chimney-piece, to cry, and say
she wanted Mamma.</p>

<p>The Nurse and Mother Bunch began to comfort
her, and explain that the doctor thought
she had the scarlatina; not at all badly; but
that if any of the others caught it, nobody could
guess how bad they would be; especially
Mamma, who had just been ill; and so she was
to be rolled up in her blankets, and put into a
carriage, and taken to her uncle's; and there she
would stay till she was not only well, but could
safely come home without carrying infection
about with her.</p>

<p>Lucy was a good little girl, and knew that
she must bear it; so, though she could not
help crying a little when she found she must
not kiss any one, nay not even see them, and
that nobody might go with her but Lonicera,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
her own washing doll, she made up her mind
bravely; and she was a good deal cheered when
Clare, the biggest and best of all the dolls, was
sent in to her, with all her clothes, by Maude,
her eldest sister, to be her companion,&mdash;it was
such an honour and so very kind of Maude
that it quite warmed the sad little heart.</p>

<p>So Lucy had her little scarlet flannel dressing
gown on, and her shoes and stockings, and a
wonderful old knitted hood with a tippet to it,
and then she was rolled round and round in
all her bed-clothes, and Mrs. Bunker took her
up like a very big baby, not letting any one
else touch her. How Mrs. Bunker got safe down
all the stairs no one can tell, but she did, and
into the fly, and there poor little Lucy looked
back and saw at the windows Mamma's face,
and Papa's, and Maude's, and all the rest, all
nodding and smiling to her, but Maude was
crying all the time, and perhaps Mamma was
too.</p>

<p>The journey seemed very long; and Lucy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was really tired when she was put down at last
in a big bed, nicely warmed for her, and with
a bright fire in the room. As soon as she had
had some beef-tea, she went off soundly to
sleep, and only woke to drink tea, and administer
supper to the dolls, and put them to sleep.</p>

<p>The next evening she was sitting up by the
fire, and on the fourth day she was running
about the house as if nothing had ever been
the matter with her, but she was not to go
home for a fortnight; and being wet, cold, dull
weather, it was not always easy to amuse
herself. She had her dolls, to be sure, and
the little dog Don, to play with, and sometimes
Mrs. Bunker would let her make funny things
with the dough, or stone the raisins, or even
help make a pudding; but still there was a
good deal of time on her hands. She had only
two books with her, and the rash had made
her eyes weak, so that she did not much like
reading them. The notes that every one wrote
from home were quite enough for her. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
she liked best&mdash;that is, when Mrs. Bunker could
not attend to her&mdash;was to wander about the
museum, explaining the things to the dolls:
"That is a crocodile, Lonicera; it eats people
up, and has a little bird to pick its teeth.
Look, Clare, that bony thing is a skeleton&mdash;the
skeleton of a lizard. Paws off, my dear;
mustn't touch. That's amber, just like barley
sugar, only not so nice; people make necklaces
of it. There's a poor little dead fly inside.
Those are the dear delightful humming-birds;
look at their crests, just like Mamma's jewels.
See the shells; aren't they beauties? People
get pearls out of those great flat ones, and dive
all down to the bottom of the sea after them;
mustn't touch, my dear, only look; paws off."</p>

<p>One would think Clare's curved fingers all in
one piece, and Lonicera's blue leather hands had
been very movable and mischievous, judging by
the number of times this warning came; but of
course it was Lucy herself who wanted it most,
for her own little plump, pinky hands did almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
tingle to handle and turn round those pretty
shells. She wanted to know whether the amber
tasted like barley-sugar as it looked, and there
was a little musk deer, no bigger than Don,
whom she longed to stroke, or still better to let
Lonicera ride; but she was a good little girl, and
had real sense of honour, which never betrays a
trust, so she never laid a finger on anything but
what Uncle Joe had once given all free leave to
move.</p>

<p>This was a very big pair of globes&mdash;bigger
than globes commonly are now, and with more
frames round them&mdash;one great flat one, with odd
names painted on it, and another brass one,
nearly upright, going half-way round from top
to bottom, and with the globe hung upon it by
two pins, which Lucy's elder sisters called the
poles, or the ends of the axis. The huge round
balls went very easily with a slight touch, and
there was something very charming in making
them go whisk, whisk, whisk; now faster, now
slower, now spinning so quickly that nothing on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
them could be seen, now turning slowly and
gradually over and showing all that was on
them.</p>

<p>The mere twirling was quite enough for Lucy
at first, but soon she liked to look at what was
on them. One she thought much more entertaining
than the other. It was covered with
wonderful creatures: one bear was fastened by
his long tail to the pole; another bigger one
was trotting round; a snake was coiling about
anywhere; a lady stood disconsolate against a
rock; another sat in a chair; a giant sprawled
with a club in one hand and a lion's skin in the
other; a big dog and a little dog stood on their
hind legs; a lion seemed just about to spring
on a young maiden's head; and all were thickly
spotted over, just as if they had Lucy's rash,
with stars big and little: and still more
strange, her brothers declared these were the
stars in the sky, and this was the way people
found their road at sea; but if Lucy asked how,
they always said she was not big enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
understand, and it had not occurred to Lucy
to ask whether the truth was not that they
were not big enough to explain.</p>

<p>The other globe was all in pale green, with
pink and yellow outlines on it, and quantities
of names. Lucy had had to learn some of
these names for her geography, and she did
not want to think of lessons now, so she rather
kept out of the way of looking at it at first,
till she had really grown tired of all the odd
men and women and creatures upon the celestial
sphere; but by and by she began to roll the
other by way of variety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>VISITORS FROM THE SOUTH SEAS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Miss</span> Lucy, you're as quiet as a mouse.
Not in any mischief?" said Mrs. Bunker, looking
into the museum; "why, what are you doing
there?"</p>

<p>"I'm looking at the great big globe, that
Uncle Joe said I might touch," said Lucy:
"here are all the names just like my lesson
book at home; Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America."</p>

<p>"Why, bless the child! where else should
they be? There be all the oceans and seas
besides that I've crossed over, many's the time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with poor Ben Bunker, who was last seen off
Cape Hatteras."</p>

<p>"What, all these great green places, with
Atlantic and Pacific on them; you don't really
mean that you've sailed over them! I should
like to make a midge do it in a husk of hemp-seed!
How could you, Mother Bunch? You
are not small enough."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" said the housekeeper, laughing;
"does the child think I sailed on that very
globe there?"</p>

<p>"I know one learns names," said Lucy; "but
is it real?"</p>

<p>"Real! Why, Missie, don't you see it's a
sort of a picture? There's your photograph
now, it's not as big as you, but it shows you;
and so a chart, or a map, or a globe, is just
a picture of the shapes of the coast-line of the
land and the sea, and the rivers in them, and
mountains, and the like. Look you here:"
and she made Lucy stand on a chair and look
at a map of her own town that was hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
against the wall, showing her all the chief
buildings, the churches, streets, the town hall,
and market cross, and at last helping her to
find her own Papa's house.</p>

<p>When Lucy had traced all the corners she
had to turn in going from home to Uncle Joe's,
and had even found little frizzles for the five
lime-trees before the Vicarage, she understood
that the map was a small picture of the
situation of the buildings in the town, and
thought she could find her way to some new
place, suppose she studied it well.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Bunker showed her a big map of
the whole country, and there Lucy found the
river, and the roads, and the names of the
villages near, as she had seen or heard of
them; and she began to understand that a map
or globe really brought distant places into an
exceedingly small picture, and that where she
saw a name and a spot she was to think of
houses and churches; that a branching black
line was a flowing river full of water; a curve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in, a pretty bay shut in with rocks and hills;
a point jutting out, generally a steep rock
with a lighthouse on it.</p>

<p>"And all these places are countries, Bunchey,
are they, with fields and houses like ours?"</p>

<p>"Houses, ay, and fields, but not always so
very like ours, Miss Lucy."</p>

<p>"And are there little children, boys and girls,
in them all?"</p>

<p>"To be sure there are, else how would the
world go on? Why, I've seen 'em by swarms,
white or brown or black, running down to the
shore, as sure as the vessel cast anchor; and
whatever colour they were, you might be sure
of two things, Miss Lucy, that they were all
alike in."</p>

<p>"Oh, what, Mrs. Bunker?"</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 301px;"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
<img src="images/i001.jpg" width="301" height="400" alt="&quot;Do please sit down, there&#39;s a good Mother Bunch, and tell me all about them.&quot;" title="&quot;Do please sit down, there&#39;s a good Mother Bunch, and tell me all about them.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Do please sit down, there&#39;s a good Mother Bunch, and tell me all about them.&quot;</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 18.</i></div></div>

<p>"Why, in plenty of noise for one, and the
other for wanting all they could get to eat.
But they were little darlings, some of them, if
I only could have got at them to make them a
bit nicer. Some of them looked for all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
world like the little bronze images Master has
got in the museum, brought from Italy, and
hadn't a rag more clothing neither. They were
in India. Dear, dear, to see them tumble about
in the surf!"</p>

<p>"O, what fun! what fun! I wish I could see
them. Suppose I could."</p>

<p>"You would be right glad, Missie, I can tell
you, if you had been three or four months
aboard with nothing but dry biscuits and salt
junk, and may be a tin of preserved vegetables
just to keep it wholesome, to see the black
fellows come grinning alongside with their boats
and canoes all full of oranges and limes and
shaddocks and cocoa-nuts. Doesn't one's mouth
fairly water for them?"</p>

<p>"Do please sit down, there's a good Mother
Bunch, and tell me all about them? Come,
suppose you do."</p>

<p>"Suppose I did, Miss Lucy, and where would
your poor uncle's preserved ginger be, that no
one knows from real West Indian?"</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
"Oh, let me come into your room, and you
can tell me all the time you are doing the
ginger."</p>

<p>"It is very hot there, Missie."</p>

<p>"That will be more like some of the places.
I'll suppose I'm there! Look, Mrs. Bunker,
here's a whole green sea, all over the tiniest
little dots. There can't be people in them."</p>

<p>"Dots? You'd hardly see all over one of those
dots if you were in one. That's the South Sea
Miss Lucy, and those are the loveliest isles,
except, may be, the West Indies, that ever I
saw."</p>

<p>"Tell me about them, please," entreated Lucy
"Here's one; its name is&mdash;is Ysabel&mdash;such a
little wee one."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="301" height="400" alt="Lucy had a great sneezing fit, and when she looked again into the smoke, what did she see but two little black figures." title="Lucy had a great sneezing fit, and when she looked again into the smoke, what did she see but two little black figures." />
<span class="caption">Lucy had a great sneezing fit, and when she looked again into the smoke, what did she see but two little black figures.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 22.</i></div></div>


<p>"I can't tell you much of those South Sea
Isles, Missie, being that I only made one
voyage among them, when Bunker chartered the
<i>Penguin</i> for the sandal-wood trade; and we did
not touch at many, being that the natives were
fierce and savage, and made nothing of coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
down with arrows and spears at a boat's crew.
So we only went to such islands as the missionaries
had been at, and got the people to be
more civil and conformable."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," said Lucy, following
the old woman hither and thither as she bustled
about, talking all the time, and stirring her pan
of ginger over the hot plate.</p>

<p>How it happened, it is not easy to say; the
room was very warm, and Mother Bunch went
on talking as she stirred, and a steam rose up,
and by and by it seemed to Lucy that she had
a great sneezing fit, and when she looked again
into the smoke, what did she see but two little
black figures, faces, heads, and feet all black,
but with an odd sort of white garment round
their waists, and some fine red and green
feathers sticking out of their woolly heads.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bunker, Mrs. Bunker," she cried, "what's
this? who are these ugly figures?"</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="&quot;I am so glad to see you. Hush, Don! don&#39;t bark so!&quot;" title="&quot;I am so glad to see you. Hush, Don! don&#39;t bark so!&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I am so glad to see you. Hush, Don! don&#39;t bark so!&quot;</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 27.</i></div></div>


<p>"Ugly!" said the foremost; and though it
must have been some strange language, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
sounded like English to Lucy. "Is that the
way little white girl speaks to boy and girl that
have come all the way from Ysabel to see
her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! little Ysabel boy, I beg your
pardon. I didn't know you were real, nor that
you could understand me! I am so glad to see
you. Hush, Don! don't bark so!"</p>

<p>"Pig, pig, I never heard a pig squeak like
that," said the black stranger.</p>

<p>"Pig! It is a little dog. Have you no dogs
in your country?"</p>

<p>"Pigs go on four legs. That must be pig."</p>

<p>"What, you have nothing that goes on four
legs but a pig! What do you eat, then, besides
pig?"</p>

<p>"Yams, cocoa-nut, fish&mdash;oh, so good, and put
pig into hole among hot stones, make a fire
over, bake so nice!"</p>

<p>"You shall have some of my tea and see if
that is as nice," said Lucy. "What a funny
dress you have; what is it made of?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tapa cloth," said the little girl. "We get
the bark off the tree, and then we go hammer,
hammer, thump, thump, till all the hard thick
stuff comes off;" and Lucy, looking near, saw
that the substance was really all a lacework of
fibre, about as close as the net of Nurse's caps.</p>

<p>"Is that all your clothes?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, till I am a warrior," said the boy;
"then they will tattoo my forehead, and arms,
and breast, and legs."</p>

<p>"Tattoo! what's that?"</p>

<p>"Make little holes, and lines all over the skin
with a sharp shell, and rub in juice that turns
it all to blue and purple lines."</p>

<p>"But doesn't it hurt dreadfully?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"Hurt! to be sure it does, but that will show
that I am brave. When Father comes home
from the war, he paints himself white."</p>

<p>"White!"</p>

<p>"With lime made by burning coral, and he
jumps and dances and shouts: I shall go to
the war one of these days."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh no, don't!" said Lucy, "it is horrid."</p>

<p>The boy laughed, but the little girl whispered,
"Good white men say so. Some day Lavo will
go and learn, and leave off fighting."</p>

<p>Lavo shook his head. "No, not yet; I will
be brave chief and warrior first,&mdash;bring home
many heads of enemies."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think it nice to be quiet," said Lucy;
"and&mdash;and&mdash;won't you have some dinner?"</p>

<p>"Have you baked a pig?" asked Lavo.</p>

<p>"I think this is mutton," said Lucy, when
the dish came up,&mdash;"it is sheep's flesh."</p>

<p>Lavo and his sister had no notion what sheep
were. They wanted to sit cross-legged on the
floor, but Lucy made each of them sit in a
chair properly; but then they shocked her by
picking up the mutton-chops and stuffing them
into their mouths with their fingers.</p>

<p>"Look here!" and she showed the knives and forks.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Lavo, "what good spikes to
catch fish with! and knife&mdash;knife&mdash;I'll kill foes!
much better than shell knife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 309px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;I can eat much better without,&quot; said Lavo.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 30.</i></div></div>



<p>"And I'll dig yams," said the sister.</p>

<p>"Oh no!" entreated Lucy, "we have spades
to dig with, soldiers have swords to fight with,
these are to eat with."</p>

<p>"I can eat much better without," said Lavo,
but to please Lucy his sister did try; slashing
hard away with her knife, and digging her fork
straight into a bit of meat. Then she very
nearly ran it into her eye, and Lucy, who
knew it was not good manners to laugh, was
very near choking herself. And at last, saying
the knife and fork were "great good&mdash;great
good; but none for eating," they stuck them
through the great tortoiseshell rings they had
in their ears and noses. Lucy was distressed
about Uncle Joseph's knives and forks, which
she knew she ought not to give away; but
while she was looking about for Mrs. Bunker to
interfere, Don seemed to think it his business,
and began to growl and fly at the little black
legs.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 285px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="285" height="400" alt="Lavo had climbed up the side of the door, and was sitting astride on the top of it." title="Lavo had climbed up the side of the door, and was sitting astride on the top of it." />
<span class="caption">Lavo had climbed up the side of the door, and was sitting astride on the top of it.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 35.</i></div></div>



<p>"A tree, a tree!" cried the Ysabelites, "where's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a tree?" and while they spoke, Lavo had climbed
up the side of the door, and was sitting astride on
the top of it, grinning down at the dog, and his
sister had her feet on the lock, going up after
him.</p>

<p>"Tree houses," they cried; "there we are safe
from our enemies."</p>

<p>And Lucy found rising before her, instead of
her own nursery, a huge tree, on the top of a
mound.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Basket-work had been woven between
the branches to make floors, and on these were
huts of bamboo cane; there were ladders hanging
down made of strong creepers twisted together,
and above and around the cries of cockatoos and
parrots and the chirp of grasshoppers rang in her
ears. She laid hold of the ladder of creeping
plants and began to climb, but soon her head
swam, she grew giddy, and called out to Lavo
to help her. Then suddenly she found herself
curled up in Mrs. Bunker's big beehive chair,
and she wondered whether she had been asleep.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>ITALY.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Suppose</span> and suppose I could have such
another funny dream," said Lucy. "Mother
Bunch, have you ever been to Italy?" and she
put her finger on the long leg and foot, kicking
at three-cornered Sicily.</p>

<p>"Yes, Missie, that I have; come out of this
cold room and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>Lucy was soon curled in her chair; but no,
she wasn't! she was under such a blue, blue
sky, as she had never dreamt of: clear sharp
purple hills rose up against it. There was a
clear rippling little fountain, bursting out of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
rock, carved with old, old carvings, broken now
and defaced, but shadowed over by lovely
maidenhair fern and trailing bindweed; and in
a niche above a little roof, sheltering a figure
of the Blessed Virgin. Some way off stood a
long low house propped up against the rich
yellow stone walls and pillars of another old,
old building, and with a great chestnut-tree
shadowing over it. It had a balcony, and the
gable end was open, and full of big yellow
pumpkins and clusters of grapes hung up to
dry, and some goats were feeding round.</p>

<p>Then came a merry, merry voice singing
something about <i>la vendemmia</i>; and though
Lucy had never learnt Italian, her wonderful
dream knowledge made her sure that this
meant the vintage, the grape-gathering; and
presently there came along a little girl dancing
and beating a tambourine, with a basket
fastened to her back, filled to overflowing with
big, beautiful bunches of grapes: and a whole
party of other children, all loaded with as many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
grapes as they could carry, came leaping and
singing after her; their black hair loose, or
sometimes twisted with vine-leaves; their big
black eyes dancing with merriment, and their
bare brown legs with glee.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="298" height="400" alt="&quot;Ah! Cecco, Cecco!&quot; cried the little girl, pausing as she beat her tambourine." title="&quot;Ah! Cecco, Cecco!&quot; cried the little girl, pausing as she beat her tambourine." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Ah! Cecco, Cecco!&quot; cried the little girl, pausing as she beat her tambourine.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 38.</i></div></div>



<p>"Ah! Cecco, Cecco!" cried the little girl,
pausing as she beat her tambourine, "here's a
stranger who has no grapes; give them here!"</p>

<p>"But," said Lucy, "aren't they your Mamma's
grapes; may you give them away?"</p>

<p>"Ah, ah! 'tis the <i>vendemmia</i>! all may eat
grapes; as much as they will. See, there's the
vineyard."</p>

<p>Lucy saw on the slope of the hill above the
cottage long poles such as hops grow upon,
and vines trained about hither and thither in
long festoons, with leaves growing purple with
autumn, and clusters hanging down. Men in
shady battered hats, bright sashes and braces,
and white shirt sleeves, and women with handkerchiefs
folded square over their heads, were
cutting the grapes down, and piling them up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in baskets; and a low cart drawn by two
mouse-coloured oxen, with enormous wide horns
and gentle-looking eyes, was waiting to be
loaded with the baskets.</p>

<p>"To the wine-press! to the press!" shouted
the children, who were politeness itself and
wanted to show her everything.</p>

<p>The wine-press was a great marble trough
with pipes leading off into other vessels around.
Into it went the grapes, and in the midst were
men and boys and little children, all with bare
feet and legs up to the knees, dancing and
leaping, and bounding and skipping upon the
grapes, while the red juice covered their brown
skins.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in; you don't know how
charming it is!" cried Cecco. "It is the best
time of all the year, the dear vintage; come
and tread the grapes."</p>

<p>"But you must take off your shoes and
stockings," said his sister, Nunziata; "we never
wear them but on Sundays and holidays."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucy was not sure that she might, but the
children looked so joyous, and it seemed to be
such fun, that she began fumbling with the
buttons of her boots, and while she was doing
it she opened her eyes, and found that her
beautiful bunch of grapes was only the cushion
in the bottom of Mother Bunch's chair.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>GREENLAND.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Suppose</span> and suppose I tried what the very
cold countries are like!"</p>

<p>And Lucy bent over the globe till she was
nearly ready to cut her head off with the brass
meridian, as she looked at the long jagged
tongue, with no particular top to it, hanging
down on the east side of America. Perhaps
it was the making herself so cold that did it,
but she found herself in the midst of snow,
snow, snow. All was snow except the sea, and
that was a deep green, and in it were monstrous
floating white things, pinnacled all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
like the Cathedral, and as big, and with hollows
in them of glorious deep blue and green, like
jewels; Lucy knew they were icebergs. A sort
of fringe of these cliffs of ice hemmed in the
shore. And on one of them stood what she
thought at first was a little brown bear, for
the light was odd, the sun was so very low
down, and there was so much glare from the
snow that it seemed unnatural. However, before
she had time to be afraid of the bear,
she saw that it was really a little boy, with a
hood and coat and leggings all of thick, thick
fur, and a spear in his hand, with which he
every now and then made a dash at a fish,&mdash;great
cod fish, such as Mamma had, with
oysters, when there was a dinner-party.</p>

<p>Into them went his spear, up came the poor
fish, and was strung with some others on a
string the boy carried. Lucy crept up as well
as she could on the slippery ice, and the little
Esquimaux stared at her with a kind of stupid
surprise.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="294" height="400" alt="&quot;Is that the way you get fish?&quot; she asked." title="&quot;Is that the way you get fish?&quot; she asked." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Is that the way you get fish?&quot; she asked.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 47.</i></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>"Is that the way you get fish?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and seals; Father gets them," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's that, swimming out there?"</p>

<p>"That's a white bear," he said, coolly; "we
had better get home."</p>

<p>Lucy thought so indeed; only where was
home? that puzzled her. However, she trotted
along by the side of her companion, and
presently came to what might have been an
enormous snowball, but there was a hole in it.
Yes, it was hollow; and as her companion made
for the opening, she saw more little stout figures
rolled up in furs inside. Then she perceived
that it was a house built up of blocks of snow,
arranged so as to make the shape of a beehive,
all frozen together, and with a window of ice.
It made her shiver to think of going in, but she
thought the white bear might come after her,
and in she went. Even her little head had to
bend under the low doorway, and behold it was
the very closest, stuffiest, if not the hottest place
she had ever been in! There was a kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
lamp burning in the hut; that is, a wick was
floating in some oil, but there was no glass,
such as Lucy had been apt to think the chief
part of a lamp, and all round it squatted upon
skins these queer little stumpy figures, dressed
so much alike that there was no knowing the
men from the women, except that the women
had much the biggest boots, and used them
instead of pockets, and they had their babies in
bags of skin upon their backs.</p>

<p>They seemed to be kind people, for they
made room by their lamp for the little girl, and
asked her where she had been wrecked, and then
one of the women cut off a great lump of raw
something&mdash;was it a walrus, with that round
head and big tusks?&mdash;and held it up to her;
and when Lucy shook her head and said, "No,
thank you," as civilly as she could, the woman
tore it in two, and handed a lump over her
shoulder to her baby, who began to gnaw it.
Then her first friend, the little boy, hoping to
please her better, offered her some drink. Ah!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
it was oil, just like the oil that was burning in
the lamp!&mdash;horrid train-oil from the whales! She
could not help shaking her head, so much that
she woke herself up!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>TYROL.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Suppose</span> and suppose I could see where that
dear little black chamois horn came from! But
Mother Bunch can't tell me about that I'm
afraid, for she always went by sea, and here's
the Tyrol without one bit of sea near it. It's
just one of the strings to the great knot of
mountains that tie Europe up in the middle.
Oh! what is a mountain like?"</p>

<p>Then suddenly came on Lucy's ears a loud
blast like a trumpet; another answered it farther
off, another fainter still, and as she started up
she found she was standing on a little shelf of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
green grass with steep slopes of stones and
rock above, below, and around her; and rising
up all round huge, tall hills, their smooth slopes
green and grassy, but in the steep places, all
steep, stern cliff and precipice, and as they were
seen further away they were of a beautiful
purple, like a thunder-cloud. Close to Lucy
grew blue gentians like those in Mamma's
garden, and Alpine roses, and black orchises;
but she did not know how to come down, and
was getting rather frightened when a clear little
voice said, "Little lady, have you lost your
way? Wait till the evening hymn is over, and
I'll come and help you;" and then Lucy stood
and listened, while from all the peaks whence
the horns had been blown there came the strong
sweet sound of an evening hymn, all joining
together, while there arose distant echoes of
others farther away. When it was over, one
shout of "Jodel" echoed from each point, and
then all was still except for the tinkling of a
little cow-bell. "That's the way we wish each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
other good night," said the little girl, as the
shadows mounted high on the tops of the mountains,
leaving them only peaks of rosy light.
"Now come to the ch&acirc;let, and sister Rose will
give you some milk."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Help me, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; said Lucy.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 52.</i></div></div>

<p>"Help me. I'm afraid," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"That is nothing," said the mountain maiden
springing up to her like a kid, in spite of her
great heavy shoes; "you should see the places
Father and Seppel climb when they hunt the
chamois."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Lucy, who much
liked the looks of her little companion in her
broad straw hat, with a bunch of Alpine roses
in it, her thick striped frock, and white body and
sleeves, braced with black ribbon; it was such a
pleasant, fresh, open face, with such rosy cheeks
and kindly blue eyes, that Lucy felt quite
at home.</p>

<p>"I am little Katherl. This is the first time I
have come up with Rose to the ch&acirc;let, for I am
big enough to milk the cows now. Ah! do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
see Ilse, the black one with a white tuft? She
is our leading cow, and she knows it, the darling.
She never lets the others get into dangerous
places they cannot come off; she leads them
home, at a sound of the horn; and when we go
back to the village, she will lead the herd with
a nosegay on the point of each horn, and a
wreath round her neck. The men will come up
and fetch us, Seppel and all; and may be Seppel
will bring the medal for shooting with the rifle."</p>

<p>"But what do you do up here?"</p>

<p>"We girls go up for the summer with the
cows to the pastures, the grass is so rich and
good on the mountains, and we make butter and
cheese. Wait, and you shall taste. Sit down on
that stone."</p>

<p>Lucy was glad to hear this promise, for the
fresh mountain air had made her hungry. Katherl
skipped away towards a house with a projecting
wooden balcony, and deep eaves, beautifully
carved, and came back with a slice of bread and
delicious butter, and a good piece of cheese, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
on a wooden platter, and a little bowl of new
milk. Lucy thought she had never tasted
anything so nice.</p>

<p>"And now the gracious little lady will rest a
little while," said Katherl, "whilst I go and help
Rosel to strain the milk."</p>

<p>So Lucy waited, but she felt so tired with her
scramble that she could not help nodding off
to sleep, though she would have liked very
much to have stayed longer with the dear little
Tyrolese. But we know by this time where
she always found herself when she awoke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>AFRICA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Oh!</span> oh! here is the little dried crocodile
come alive, and opening a horrible great mouth
lined with terrible teeth at her.</p>

<p>No, he is no longer in the museum; he is in
a broad river, yellow, heavy, and thick with
mud; the borders are crowded with enormous
reeds and rushes; there is no getting through;
no breaking away from him; here he comes;
horrid, horrid beast! Oh, how could Lucy have
been so foolish as to want to travel in Africa
up to the higher parts of the Nile? How will
she ever get back again? He will gobble her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
up, her and Clare, who was trusted to her, and
whatever will Mamma and sister do?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="315" height="400" alt="Hark! There&#39;s a cry, and out jumps a little black figure, with a stout club in his hand." title="Hark! There&#39;s a cry, and out jumps a little black figure, with a stout club in his hand." />
<span class="caption">Hark! There&#39;s a cry, and out jumps a little black figure, with a stout club in his hand.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 58.</i></div></div>


<p>Hark! There's a cry, a great shout, and out
jumps a little black figure, with a stout club in
his hand: smash it goes down on the head of
master crocodile; the ugly beast is turning over
on its back and dying. Then Lucy has time
to look at the little Negro, and he has time to
look at her. What a droll figure he is, with his
woolly head and thick lips, the whites of his
eyes and his teeth gleaming so brightly, and his
fat little black person shining all over, as well it
may, for he is rubbed from head to foot with
castor-oil. There it grows on that bush, with
broad, beautiful, folded leaves and red stems
and the pretty grey and black nuts. Lucy only
wishes the negroes would keep it all to polish
themselves with, and not send any home.</p>

<p>She wants to give the little black fellow some
reward for saving her from the crocodile, and
luckily Clare has on her long necklace of blue
glass beads. She puts it into his hand, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
twists it round his black wool, and cuts such
dances and capers for joy that Lucy can hardly
stand for laughing; but the sun shines scorching
hot upon her, and she gets under the shade of
a tall date palm, with big leaves all shooting
out together at the top, and fine bunches of
dates below, all fresh and green, not dried like
those Papa sometimes gives her at dessert.</p>

<p>The little negro, Tojo, asks if she would like
some; he takes her by the hand, and leads
her into a whole cluster of little round mud
huts, telling her that he is Tojo, the king's son;
she is his little sister, and these are all his
mothers! Which is his real mother Lucy cannot
quite make out, for she sees an immense party
of black women, all shiny and polished, with a
great many beads wound round their heads,
necks, ankles, and wrists; and nothing besides
the tiniest short petticoats: and all the fattest
are the smartest; indeed, they have gourds of
milk beside them, and are drinking it all day
long to keep themselves fat. No sooner however<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is Lucy led in among them, than they all close
round, some singing and dancing, and others
laughing for joy, and crying, "Welcome little
daughter, from the land of spirits!" and then
she finds out that they think she is really Tojo's
little sister, who died ten moons ago, come back
again from the grave as a white spirit.</p>

<p>Tojo's own mother, a very fat woman indeed,
holds out her arms, as big as bed-posts and
terribly greasy, gives her a dose of sour milk out
of a gourd, makes her lie down with her head
in her lap, and begins to sing to her, till Lucy
goes to sleep; and wakes, very glad to see the
crocodile as brown and hard and immovable as
ever; and that odd round gourd with a little
hole in it, hanging up from the ceiling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>LAPLANDERS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> shall not be a hot country next time,"
said Lucy, "though, after all, the whale oil was
not much worse than the castor oil.&mdash;Mother
Bunch, did your whaler always go to Greenland,
and never to any nicer place?"</p>

<p>"Well, Missie, once we were driven between
foul winds and icebergs up into a fiord near
North Cape, right at midsummer, and I'll never
forget what we saw there."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 291px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="291" height="400" alt="And here beside her was a little fellow with a bow and arrows, such as she had never seen before." title="And here beside her was a little fellow with a bow and arrows, such as she had never seen before." />
<span class="caption">And here beside her was a little fellow with a bow and arrows, such as she had never seen before.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 64.</i></div></div>


<p>Lucy was not likely to forget, either, for she
found herself standing by a narrow inlet of sea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
as blue and smooth as a lake, and closely shut
in, except on the west, with red rocky hills
and precipices with pine-trees growing on them,
except where the bare rock was too steep, or
where on a somewhat smoother shelf stood a
timbered house, with a farm-yard and barns all
round it. But the odd thing was that the sun
was where she had never seen him before,&mdash;quite
in the north, making all the shadows come
the wrong way. But how came the sun to be
visible at all so very late? Ah! she knew it
now; this was Norway, and there was no night
at all!</p>

<p>And here beside her was a little fellow with
a bow and arrows, such as she had never seen
before, except in the hands of the little Cupids
in the pictures in the drawing-room. Mother
Bunch had said that the little brown boys in
India looked like the bronze Cupid who was on
the mantelshelf, but this little boy was white, or
rather sallow-faced, and well dressed too, in a
tight, round, leather cap, and a dark blue kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of shaggy gown with hairy leggings; and what
he was shooting at was some kind of wild-duck
or goose, that came tumbling down heavily with
the arrow right across its neck.</p>

<p>"There," said the boy, "I'll take that, and sell
it to the Norse bonder's wife up in the house
above there."</p>

<p>"Who are you, then?" said Lucy.</p>

<p>"I'm a Lapp. We live on the hills, where the
Norseman has not driven us away, and the
reindeer find their grass in summer and their
moss in winter."</p>

<p>"Oh! have you got reindeer? I should so
like to see them and to drive in a sledge!"</p>

<p>The boy, whose name was Peder, laughed, and
said, "You can't go in a sledge except when it
is winter, with snow and ice to go upon, but I'll
soon show you a reindeer."</p>

<p>Then he led the way, past the deliciously
smelling, whispering pine-woods that sheltered
the Norwegian homestead, starting a little aside
when a great, tall, fair-faced, fair-haired Norse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
farmer came striding along, singing some old
old song, as he carried a heavy log on his
shoulder, past a seater or mountain meadow
where the girls were pasturing their cows, much
like Lucy's friends in the Tirol, out upon the
grey moorland, where there was an odd little
cluster of tents covered with skins, and droll
little, short, stumpy people running about
them.</p>

<p>Peder gave a curious long cry, put his hand
in his pocket, and pulled out a lump of salt.
Presently, a pair of long horns appeared, then
another, then a whole herd of the deer with big
heads and horns growing a good deal forward.
The salt was held to them, and a rope was
fastened to all their horns that they might stand
still in a line, while the little Lapp women milked
them. Peder went up to one of the women, and
brought back a little cupful for his visitor; it
was all that one deer gave, but it was so rich as
to be almost like drinking cream. He led her
into one of the tents, but it was very smoky,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and not much cleaner than the Esquimaux. It
is a wonder how Lucy could go to sleep there,
but she did, heartily wishing herself somewhere
else.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CHINA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> it the scent of the perfumed tea, a present
from an old sailor friend, which Mrs. Bunker was
putting away, or was it the sight of the red
jar ornamented with little black-and-gold men,
with round caps, long petticoats, and pigtails, that
caused Lucy next to open her eyes upon a cane
sofa, with cushions ornamented with figures in
coloured silks? The floor of the room was of
shining inlaid wood; there were beautifully woven
mats all round; stands made of red lacquer
work, and seats of cane and bamboo; and there
was a round window, through which could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
seen a beautiful garden, full of flowering shrubs
and trees, a clear pond lined with coloured tiles
in the middle, and over the wall the gilded roof
of a pagoda, like an umbrella, only all in ridge
and furrow, and with a little bell at every spoke.
Beyond, were beautifully and fantastically shaped
hills, and a lake below with pleasure boats on
it. It was all wonderfully like being upon a
bowl come to life, and Lucy knew she was in
China, even before there came into the room,
toddling upon her poor little tiny feet, a young
lady with a small yellow face, little slips of eyes
sloping upwards from her flat nose, and back
hair combed up very tight from her face, and
twisted up with flowers and ornaments. She
had ever so many robes on, the edge of one
peeping out below the other, and at the top a
sort of blue China-crape tunic, with very wide
loose sleeves drooping an immense way from
her hands. There was no gathering in at the
waist, and it reached to her knees, where a still
more splendid white silk, embroidered, trailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
along. She had a big fan in her hand, but when
she saw the visitor she went up to a beautiful
little low table, with an ivory frill round it,
where stood some dainty, delicate tea-cups and
saucers. Into one of these she put a little ball,
about as big as an oak-apple, of tea-leaves; a
maid dressed like herself poured hot water on
it, and handed it on a lacquer-work tray. Lucy
took it, said, "Thank you," and then waited.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="297" height="400" alt="&quot;Is it not good?&quot; said the little hostess." title="&quot;Is it not good?&quot; said the little hostess." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Is it not good?&quot; said the little hostess.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 72.</i></div></div>


<p>"Is it not good?" said the little hostess.</p>

<p>"It must be! You are the real tea people,"
said Lucy; "but I was waiting for sugar and
milk."</p>

<p>"That would spoil it," said the Chinese damsel;
"only outer barbarians would think of such
a thing. And, ah! I see you are one! See,
Ki-hi, what monstrous feet!"</p>

<p>"They are not bigger than your maid's,"
said Lucy, rather disgusted. "Why are yours
so small?"</p>

<p>"Because my mother and nurse took care of
me when I was a baby, and bound them up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that they might not grow big and ugly like
the poor creatures who have to run about for
their husbands, feed silkworms, and tend ducks!"</p>

<p>"But shouldn't you like to walk without
almost tumbling down?" said Lucy.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Me, a daughter of a mandarin
of the blue button! You are a mere barbarian
to think a lady ought to want to walk. Do
you not see that I never do anything? Look
at my lovely nails."</p>

<p>"I think they are claws," said Lucy; "do
you never break them?"</p>

<p>"No; when they are a little longer, I shall
wear silver shields for them, as my mother
does."</p>

<p>"And do you really never work?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," said the young lady,
scornfully fanning herself; "I leave that to the
common folk, who are obliged. Come with me
and let me lean on you, and I will give you a
peep through the lattice, that you may see that
my father is far above making his daughter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
work. See, there he sits, with his moustachios
hanging down to his chin, and his tail to his
heels, and the blue dragon embroidered on his
breast, watching while they prepare the hall for
a grand dinner. There will be a stew of puppy
dog, and another of kittens, and birds-nest
soup; and then the players will come and act
a part of the nine-night tragedy, and we will
look through the lattice. Ah! Father is
smoking opium, that he may be serene and in
good spirits! Does it make your head ache?
Ah! that is because you are a mere outer
barbarian. She is asleep, Ki-hi; lay her on the
sofa, and let her sleep. How ugly her pale
hair is, almost as bad as her big feet!"</p>

<span class="caption">Whisking over the snow with all her might and main, muffled up in cloaks and furs.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 79.</i></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span> had been disappointed of a drive with
the reindeer, and she had been telling Don how
useful his relations were in other places. Behold,
she awoke in a wide plain, where as far as her
eye could reach there was nothing but snow.
The few fir-trees that stood in the distance were
heavily laden; and Lucy herself,&mdash;where was
she? Going very fast? Yes, whisking over
the snow with all her might and main, and
muffled up in cloaks and furs, as indeed was
necessary, for her breath froze upon the big
muffler round her throat, so that it seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
be standing up in a wall; and by her side was
a little boy, muffled up quite as close, with a cap
or rather hood, casing his whole head, his hands
gloved in fur up to the elbows, and long fur
boots. He had an immense long whip in his
hand, and was flourishing it, and striking with
it&mdash;at what? They were an enormous way off
from him, but they really were very big dogs,
rushing along like the wind, and bearing along
with them&mdash;what? Lucy's ambition&mdash;a sledge,
a thing without wheels, but gliding along most
rapidly on the hard snow; flying, flying almost
fast enough to take away her breath, and leaving
birds, foxes, and any creature she saw for one
instant, far behind. And&mdash;what was very odd&mdash;the
young driver had no reins; he shouted at
the dogs and now and then threw a stick at
them, and they quite seemed to understand,
and turned when he wanted them. Lucy
wondered how he or they knew the way, it all
seemed such a waste of snow; and after feeling
at first as if the rapidity of their course made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
her unable to speak, she ventured on gasping
out, "Well, I've been in an express train, but
this beats it! Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Petropawlowsky, to change these skins
for whisky and coffee, and rice," answered the
boy.</p>

<p>"What skins are they?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"Bears'&mdash;big brown bears that Father killed
in a cave&mdash;and wolves' and those of the little
ermine and sable that we trap. We get much,
much for the white ermine and his black tail.
Father's coming in another sledge with, oh!
such a big pile. Don't you hear his dogs yelp?
We'll win the race yet! Ugh! hoo! hoo! hoo-o-o!&mdash;On!
on! lazy ones, on, I say! don't let
the old dogs catch the young!"</p>

<p>Crack, crack, went the whip; the dogs yelped
with eagerness,&mdash;they don't bark, those Northern
dogs; the little Kamschatkadale bawled louder
and louder, and never saw when Lucy rolled off
behind, and was left in the middle of a huge
snowdrift, while he flew on with his load.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Here were his father's dogs overtaking her;
picking her&mdash;some one picking her up. No, it
was Don! and here was Mrs. Bunker exclaiming,
"Well, I never thought to find Miss Lucy in no
better a place than on Master's old bearskin!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE TURK.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> a beautiful long necklace, Mrs. Bunker!
May I have it for Lonicera?"</p>

<p>"You may play with it while you are here,
Missie, if you'll take care not to break the
string, but it is too curious for you to take
home and lose. It is what they call a Turkish
rosary; they say it is made of rose-leaves
reduced to a paste and squeezed ever so hard
together, and that the poor ladies that are shut
up in the harems have little or nothing to do
but to run them through their fingers."</p>

<p>"It has a very nice smell," said Lucy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
examining the dark brown beads, which hung
rather loosely on their string, and letting them
fall one by one through her hands, till of course
that happened which she was hoping for: she
woke on a long low sofa, in the midst of a
room all carpet and cushions, in bright colours
and gorgeous patterns, curling about with no
particular meaning; and with a window of
rich brass lattice-work.</p>

<p>And by her side there was an odd bubbling,
that put her in mind of blowing the soap-suds
into a honey-comb when preparing them for
bubble blowing; but when she looked round
she saw something very unlike the long pipes
her brother called "churchwardens," or the
basin of soap-suds. There was a beautifully
shaped glass bottle, and into it went a long,
long twisting tube, like a snake coiled on the
floor, and the other end of the serpent, instead
of a head, had an amber mouth-piece which
went between a pair of lips. Lucy knew it for
a hubble-bubble or narghilhe, and saw that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
lips were in a brown face, with big black eyes,
round which dark bluish circles were drawn.
The jet-black hair was carefully braided with
jewels, and over it was thrown a great rose-coloured
gauze veil; there was a loose purple
satin sort of pelisse over a white silk embroidered
vest, tied in with a sash, striped with all
manner of colours, also immense wide white
muslin trousers, out of which peeped a pair of
brown bare feet, which, however, had a splendid
pair of slippers curled up at the toes.</p>

<p>The owner seemed to be very little older
than Lucy, and sat gravely looking at her for
a little while, then clapped her hands. A black
woman came, and the young Turkish maiden
said, "Bring coffee for the little Frank lady."</p>

<p>So a tiny table of mother-of-pearl was brought,
and on it some exquisite little striped porcelain
cups, standing not in saucers, but in silver
filigree cups into which they exactly fitted.
Lucy remembered her Chinese experience, and
did not venture to ask for milk or sugar, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
she found that the real Turkish coffee was so
pure and delicate that she could bear to drink
it without.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 288px;">

<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 86.</i></div></div>


<p>"Where are your jewels?" then asked the
little hostess.</p>

<p>"I'm not old enough to have any?"</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Nine."</p>

<p>"Nine! I'm only ten, and I shall be married
next week&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Married! Oh, no, you are joking."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall. Selim Bey has paid my father
the dowry for me, and I shall be taken to his
house next week."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you like him very much."</p>

<p>"He looks big and tall," said the child with
exultation. "I saw him riding when I went
with my mother to the Sweet Waters. 'Amina,'
she said, 'there is your lord, in the Frankish
coat&mdash;with the white horse.'"</p>

<p>"Have you not talked to him?"</p>

<p>"What should I do that for?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Bessie used to like to talk to nobody
but Uncle Frank before they were married."</p>

<p>"I shall talk enough when I am married. I
shall make him give me plenty of sweetmeats,
and a carriage with two handsome bullocks, and
the biggest Nubian black slave in the market
to drive me to Sweet Waters, in a thin blue
veil, with all my jewels on. Father says that
Selim Bey will give me everything, and a Frank
governess. What is a governess? Is it anything
like the little gold case you have round your neck?"</p>

<p>"My locket with Mamma's hair? Oh, no, no,"
said Lucy, laughing; "a governess is a lady to
teach you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to learn any more," said Amina,
much disgusted; "I shall tell him I can make a
pillau, and dry sweetmeats, and roll rose-leaves.
What should I learn for?"</p>

<p>"Should you not like to read and write?"</p>

<p>"Teaching is only meant for men. They have
got to read the Koran, but it is all ugly letters;
I won't learn to read."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't know how nice it is to read
stories, and all about different countries. Ah!
I wish I was in the schoolroom, at home, and
I would show you how pleasant it is."</p>

<p>And Lucy seemed to have her wish all at
once, for she and Amina stood in her own
schoolroom, but with no one else there. The
first thing Amina did was to scream, "Oh,
what shocking windows! even men can see
in; shut them up." She rolled herself up in
her veil, and Lucy could only satisfy her by
pulling down all the blinds, after which she
ventured to look about a little. "What have
you to sit on?" she asked, with great disgust.</p>

<p>"Chairs and stools," said Lucy, laughing and
showing them.</p>

<p>"These little tables with four legs! How
can you sit on them?"</p>

<p>Lucy sat down and showed her. "That is
not sitting," she said, and tried to curl herself
up cross-legged; "I can't dangle down my legs."</p>

<p>"Our governess always makes us write out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a tense of a French verb if she sees us sitting
with our legs crossed," said Lucy, laughing
with much amusement at Amina's attempts to
wriggle herself up on the stool whence she
nearly fell.</p>

<p>"Ah, I will never have a governess!" cried
Amina. "I will cry, and cry, and give Selim
Bey no rest till he promises to let me alone.
What a dreadful place this is! Where can you
sleep?"</p>

<p>"In bed, to be sure" said Lucy.</p>

<p>"I see no cushions to lie on."</p>

<p>"No; we have bedrooms, and beds there.
We should not think of taking off our clothes
here."</p>

<p>"What should you undress for?"</p>

<p>"To sleep, of course."</p>

<p>"How horrible! We sleep in all our clothes
wherever we like to lie down. We never undress
but for the bath. Do you go to the bath?"</p>

<p>"I have a bath every morning, when I get
up, in my own room."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;I will show you where you live. This is Constantinople.&quot;</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 92.</i></div></div>


<p>"Bathe at home! Then you never see your
friends? We meet at the bath, and talk and
play and laugh."</p>

<p>"Meet bathing! No, indeed! We meet at
home, and out of doors," said Lucy; "my friend
Annie and I walk together."</p>

<p>"Walk together! what, in the street? Shocking!
You cannot be a lady."</p>

<p>"Indeed I am," said Lucy, colouring up.
"My Papa is a gentleman. And see how many
books we have, and how much we have to
learn! French, and music, and sums, and
grammar, and history, and geography."</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> not be a Frank! No, no! I will
not learn," said the alarmed Amina on hearing
this catalogue poured forth.</p>

<p>"Geography is very nice," said Lucy; "here
are our maps. I will show you where you live.
This is Constantinople."</p>

<p>"I live at Stamboul," said Amina, scornfully.</p>

<p>"There is Stamboul in little letters below&mdash;look."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"That Stamboul! The Frank girl is false;
Stamboul is a large, large, beautiful place; not
a little black speck. I can see it from my
lattice. White houses and mosques in the sun,
and the blue Golden Horn, with the little
caiques gliding."</p>

<p>Before Lucy could explain, the door opened,
and one of her brothers put in his head. At
once Amina began to scream and roll herself
in the window curtain. "A man in the harem!
Oh! oh! oh! Were there no slippers at the
door?" And her screaming brought Lucy awake
at Uncle Joe's again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>SWITZERLAND.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I liked</span> the mountain girl best of all,"
thought Lucy. "I wonder whether I shall ever
get among the mountains again. There's a
great stick in the corner that Uncle Joe calls
his alpenstock. I'll go and read the names
upon it. They are all the mountains where
he has used it."</p>

<p>She read Mount Blanc, Mount Cenis, the
Wengern, and so on; and of course as she
read and sung them over to herself, they lulled
her off into her wonderful dreams, and brought
her this time into a meadow, steep and sloping,
but full of flowers, the loveliest flowers, of all
kinds, growing among the long grass that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
waved over them. The fresh clear air was so
delicious that she almost hoped she was gone
back to her dear Tyrol; but the hills were not
the same. She saw upon the slope quantities
of cows, goats, and sheep, feeding just as on
the Tyrolese Alps; but beyond was a dark row
of pines, and up above, in the sky as it were,
rose all round great sharp points&mdash;like clouds
for their whiteness, but not in their straight
jagged outlines; and here and there the deep
grey clefts between seemed to spread into
white rivers, or over the ruddy purple of the
half-distance came sharp white lines darting
downwards.</p>

<p>As she sat up in the grass and looked about
her, a bark startled her. A dog began to
growl, bark, and dance round her, so that she
would have been much frightened if the next
moment a voice had not called him off&mdash;"Fie,
Brilliant, down; let the little girl alone. <i>Fi
donc.</i> He is good, Mademoiselle, never fear.
He helps me keep the cows."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="&quot;I cut it out with my knife, all myself.&quot;" title="&quot;I cut it out with my knife, all myself.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I cut it out with my knife, all myself.&quot;</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 98.</i></div></div>



<p>"Who are you, then?"</p>

<p>"I am Maurice, the little herd-boy. I live
with my grandmother, and work for her."</p>

<p>"What, in keeping cows?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and look here!"</p>

<p>"O the delicious little cottage! It has eaves,
and windows, and balconies, and a door, and
little cows and sheep, and men and women, all
in pretty white wood! You did not make it,
Maurice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly, I did; I cut it out with my
knife, all myself."</p>

<p>"How clever you must be. And what shall
you do with it?"</p>

<p>"I shall watch for a carriage with ladies
winding up that long road; and then I shall
stand and take off my hat, and hold out my
cottage. Perhaps they will buy it, and then
I shall have enough to get grandmother a
warm gown for the winter. When I grow
bigger I will be a guide, like my father."</p>

<p>"A guide?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, to lead travellers up to the mountain-tops.
There is nowhere you English will not
go. The harder a mountain is to climb, the
more bent you are on going up. And oh, I
shall love it too! There are the great glaciers,
the broad streams of ice that fill up the furrows
of the mountains, with the crevasses so blue
and beautiful and cruel. It was in one of them
my father was swallowed up."</p>

<p>"Ah! then how can you love them?" said
Lucy.</p>

<p>"Because they are so grand and so beautiful,"
said Maurice. "No other place has the
like, and they make one's heart swell with
wonder, and joy in the God who made them.
And it is only the brave who dare to climb
them!"</p>

<p>And Maurice's eyes sparkled, and Lucy
looked at the clear, stern glory of the
mountain points, and felt as if she understood
him.</p>

<span class="caption">While he jerked out his arms and legs as if they were pulled by strings.</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 102.</i></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Caper</span>, caper; dance, dance. What a wonderful
dance it was, just as if the little fellow
had been made of cork, so high did he bound
the moment he touched the ground; while he
jerked out his arms and legs as if they were
pulled by strings, like the Marionettes that
had once performed in the front of the window.
Only, his face was all fun and life, and he did
look so proud and delighted to show what he
could do; and it was all in clear, fresh, open
air, the whole extent covered with short green
grass, upon which were grazing herds of small
lean horses, and flocks of sheep without tails,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
but with their wool puffed out behind into
a sort of bustle or <i>panier</i>. There was a cluster
of clean, white-looking houses in the distance;
and Lucy knew that she was in the great plains
called the Steppes, that lie between the rivers
Volga and Don, and may be either in Europe
or Asia, according as you look at an old map
or a new.</p>

<p>"Do you live there?" she asked, by way of
beginning the conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes; my father is the hetman of the Stantitza,
and these are my holidays. I go to school at
Tcherkask most part of the year."</p>

<p>"Tcherkask! Oh, what a funny name!"</p>

<p>"And you would think it a funny town if
you were there. It is built on a great bog by
the side of the river Volga; all the houses stand
on piles of timber, and in the spring the streets
are full of water, and one has to sail about in
boats."</p>

<p>"Oh! that must be delicious."</p>

<p>"I don't like it as much as coming home and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
riding. See!" and as he whistled, one of the
horses came whinnying up, and put his nose
over the boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Good fellow! But your horses are thin;
they look little."</p>

<p>"Little!" cried the young Cossack. "Why,
do you know what our little horses can do?
There are not many armies in Europe that they
have not ridden down, at one time or another.
Why, the church at Tcherkask is hung all round
with Colours we have taken from our enemies.
There's the Swede&mdash;didn't Charles XII. get the
worst of it when he came in his big boots after
the Cossack?&mdash;ay, and the Turk, and the Austrian,
and the German, and the French? Ah! doesn't
my grandfather tell how he rode his good little
horse all the way from the Volga to the Seine,
and the good Czar Alexander himself gave him
the medal with 'Not unto us, but unto Thy
Name be the praise'? Our father the Czar
does not think so little of us and our horses
as you do, young lady."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Lucy; "I did not
know what your horses could do."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did not! That is some excuse for
you. I'll show you."</p>

<p>And in one moment he was on the back of
his little horse, leaning down on its neck, and
galloping off over the green plain like the wind;
but it seemed to Lucy as if she had only just
watched him out of sight on one side before
he was close to her on the other, having whirled
round and cantered close up to her while she
was looking the other way. "Come up with
me," he said; and in one moment she had been
swept up before him on the little horse's neck,
and was flying so wildly over the Steppes that
her breath and sense failed her, and she knew
no more till she was safe by Mrs. Bunker's
fireside again.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>SPAIN.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Suppose</span> and suppose I go to sleep again;
what should I like to see next? A sunny
place, I think, where there is sea to look at.
Shall it be Spain, and shall it be among the
poor people? Well, I think I should like to be
where there is a little lady girl. I hope they
are not all as lazy and conceited as the Chinese
and the Turk."</p>

<p>So Lucy awoke in a large cool room with a
marble floor and heavy curtains, but with little
furniture except one table, and a row of chairs
ranged along the wall. It had two windows, one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
looking out into a garden,&mdash;such a garden!&mdash;orange-trees
with shining leaves and green and
golden fruit and white flowers, and jasmines,
and great lilies standing round about a marble
court, in the midst of which was a basin of red
marble, where a fountain was playing, making
a delicious splashing; and out beyond these
sparkled in the sun the loveliest and most
delicious of blue seas&mdash;the same blue sea, indeed,
that Lucy had seen in her Italian visit.</p>

<p>That window was empty; but the other, which
looked out into the street, had cushions laid on
the sill, an open-work stone ledge beyond, and
little looking-glasses on either side; and leaning
over this sill there was seated a little maiden
in a white frock, but with a black lace veil
fastened by a rose into her jet-black hair, and
the daintiest, prettiest-shaped little feet imaginable
in white satin shoes, which could be plainly
seen as she knelt on the window-seat.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?" asked Lucy,
coming to her side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="309" height="400" alt="&quot;See now,&quot; cried the Spaniard, &quot;stand there. Ah! have you no castanets?&quot;" title="&quot;See now,&quot; cried the Spaniard, &quot;stand there. Ah! have you no castanets?&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;See now,&quot; cried the Spaniard, &quot;stand there. Ah! have you no castanets?&quot;</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 110.</i></div></div>



<p>"I'm watching for the procession. Then I
shall go to church with Mamma. Look! That
way we shall see it come; these two mirrors
reflect everything up and down the street."</p>

<p>"Are you dressed for church?" asked Lucy.
"You have no hat on."</p>

<p>"Where does your grace come from not to
know that a mantilla is what is fit for church?
Mamma is being dressed in her black silk and
her black mantilla."</p>

<p>"And your shoes?"</p>

<p>"I could not wear great, coarse, hard shoes,"
said the little Do&ntilde;a I&ntilde;es; "it would spoil my
feet. Ah! I shall have time to show the Senorita
what I can do. Can your grace dance?"</p>

<p>"I danced with Uncle Joe at our last Christmas
party," said Lucy, with great dignity.</p>

<p>"See now," cried the Spaniard; "stand there.
Ah! have you no castanets?" and she quickly
took out two very small ivory shells or bowls,
each pair fastened together by a loop, through
which she passed her thumb so that the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
spoons hung on her palm, and she could snap
them together with her fingers.</p>

<p>Then she began to dance round Lucy in the
most graceful swimming way, now rising, now
falling, and cracking her castanets together at
intervals. Lucy tried to do the same, but her
limbs seemed like a wooden doll's compared
with the suppleness and ease of I&ntilde;es. She
made sharp corners and angles, where the
Spaniard floated so like a sea-bird that it was
like seeing her fly or float rather than merely
dance, till at last the very watching her rendered
Lucy drowsy and dizzy, and as the church bells
began to ring, and the chant of the procession
to sound, she lost all sense of being in sunny
Malaga, the home of grapes.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;What are you about, little boy?&quot;</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 114.</i></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a great murmur and buzz of
learning lessons; rows upon rows of little boys
were sitting before desks, studying; very few
heads looked up as Lucy found herself walking
round the room&mdash;a large clean room, with maps
hanging on the walls, but hot and weary-feeling,
because there were no windows open and so
little fresh air.</p>

<p>"What are you about, little boy?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am learning my verb," he said; "<i>moneo</i>,
<i>mones</i>, <i>monet</i>."</p>

<p>Lucy waited no longer, but moved off to
another desk. "And what are you doing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am writing my analysis."</p>

<p>Lucy did not know what an analysis was, so
she went a little further. "What are you doing
here?" she said timidly, for these were somewhat
bigger boys.</p>

<p>"We are drawing up an essay on the
individuality of self."</p>

<p>That was enough to frighten any one away,
and Lucy betook herself to some quite little
boys, with fat rosy faces and light hair. "Are
you busy, too?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; we are learning the chief cities of
the Fatherland."</p>

<p>Lucy felt like the little boy in the fable, who
could not get either the dog, or the bird, or the
bee, to play with him.</p>

<p>"When do you play?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We have an hour's interval after dinner, and
another at supper-time, but then we prepare our
work for the morrow," said one of the boys,
looking up well satisfied.</p>

<p>"Work! work! Are you always at work?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
exclaimed Lucy; "I only learn from nine to
half-past twelve, and half an hour to get my
lessons in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"You are a maiden," said the little boy with
civil superiority; "your brothers learn more
hours."</p>

<p>"More; yes, but not so many as you do.
They play from twelve till half-past two, and
have two half-holidays in the week."</p>

<p>"So, you are not industrious. We are. That
is the reason why we can all act together, and
think together, so much better than any others;
and we all stand as one irresistible power, the
United Germany."</p>

<p>Lucy gave a little gasp! it was all so very
wise.</p>

<p>"May I see your sisters?" she said.</p>

<p>The little sisters, Gretchens and K&auml;tchens
were learning away almost as hard as the
Hermanns and Fritzes, but the bigger sisters
had what Lucy thought a better time of it. One
of them was helping in the kitchen, and another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in the ironing; but then they had their books
and their music, and in the evening all the
families came out into the pleasure gardens, and
had little tables with coffee before them, and
the mammas knitted, and the papas smoked,
and the young ladies listened to the band. On
the whole, Lucy thought she should not mind
living in Germany, if they would not do so
many lessons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>PARIS IN THE SIEGE.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> Uncle Joe is in France, where the fathers
and brothers of those little Prussian boys have
been fighting. Suppose and suppose I could
see it."</p>

<p>There was a thunder and a whizzing in the air
and a sharp rattling noise besides; a strange,
damp, unwholesome smell too, mixed with that
of gunpowder; and when Lucy looked up, she
found herself down some steps in a dark, dull,
vaulted-looking place, lined with stone, however,
and open to the street above. A little lamp
was burning in a corner, piles of straw and bits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of furniture were lying about, and upon one of
the bundles of straw sat a little rough-haired
girl.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Ah! Mademoiselle, good morning. Are you come here to take shelter from the shells?&quot;</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 123.</i></div></div>


<p>"Ah! Mademoiselle, good morning," she said.
"Are you come here to take shelter from the
shells? The battery is firing now; I do not
think Mamma will come home till it slackens a
little. She is gone to the distribution of meat,
to get a piece of horse for my brother, who is
weak after his wounds. I wish I could offer
you something, but we have nothing but water,
and it is not even sugared."</p>

<p>"Do you live down here?" asked Lucy, looking
round at the dreary place with wonder.</p>

<p>"Not always. We used to have a pretty little
house up over, but the cruel shells came crashing in,
and flew into pieces, tearing everything to splinters,
and we are only safe from them down here.
Ah, if I could only have shown you Mamma's
pretty room! but there is a great hole in the
floor now, and the ceiling is all tumbling down,
and the table broken."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why do you stay here?"</p>

<p>"Mamma and Emily say it is all the same.
We are as safe in our cellar as we could be
anywhere, and we should have to pay elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Then you cannot get out of Paris?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, while the Prussians are all round us,
and shut us in. My brothers are all in the
Garde Mobile, and, you see, so is my doll.
Every one must be a soldier now. My dear
Adolphe, hold yourself straight" (and there the
doll certainly showed himself perfectly drilled
and disciplined). "March&mdash;right foot forward&mdash;left
foot forward." But in this movement, as
may be well supposed, little Coralie had to help
her recruit a good deal.</p>

<p>Lucy was surprised. "So you can play even
in this dreadful place?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh yes! What's the use of crying and
wearying oneself? I do not mind as long as
they leave me my kitten, my dear little Minette."</p>

<p>"Oh! what a pretty long-haired kitten! but
how small and thin!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, truly, the poor Minette! The cruel
people ate her mother, and there is no milk&mdash;no
milk, and my poor Minette is almost starved,
though I give her bits of my bread and soup;
but the bread is only bran and sawdust, and
she likes it no more than I."</p>

<p>"Ate up her mother!"</p>

<p>"Yes. She was a superb Cyprus cat, all grey;
but, alas I one day she took a walk in the street,
and they caught her, and then indeed it was all
over with her. I only hope Minette will not
get out, but she is so lean that they would find
little but bones and fur."</p>

<p>"Ah, how I wish I could take you and her
home to Uncle Joe, and give you both good
bread and milk! Take my hand, and shut
your eyes, and we will suppose and suppose
very hard, and, perhaps, you will come there
with me. Paris is not so very far off."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span>; supposing very hard did not bring poor
little French Coralie home with Lucy; but
something almost as wonderful happened. Just
at the time in the afternoon, blind man's holiday,
when Lucy had been used to ride off on her
dream to visit some wonderful place, there came
a knock at the front door; a quite real substantial
English knock and ring, that did not sound
at all like any of the strange noise of the strange
worlds that she had lately been hearing, but had
the real tinkle of Uncle Joe's own bell.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Bunker, "what can that
be, coming at this time of day? It can never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
be the doctor coming home without sending
orders! Don't you be running out, Miss Lucy;
there'll be a draught of cold right in."</p>

<p>Lucy stood still; very anxious, and wondering
whether she should see anything alive, or one of
her visitors from various countries.</p>

<p>"There is a letter from Mr. Seaman," said a
brisk young voice, that would have been very
pleasant if it had not gone a little through the
nose; and past Mrs. Bunker there walked into
the full light a little boy, a year or two older
than Lucy, holding out one hand as he saw her
and taking off his hat with the other. "Good
morning," he said, quite at his ease; "is this
where you live?"</p>

<p>"Good morning," returned Lucy, though it
was not morning at all; "where do you come
from?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm from Paris last; but when I'm at
home, I'm at Boston. I am Leonidas Saunders,
of the great American Republic."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you are not real, after all?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Real! I should hope I was a genuine
article."</p>

<p>"Well, I was in hopes that you were real,
only you say you come from a strange country,
like the rest of them, and yet you look just
like an English boy."</p>

<p>"Of course I do! my great grandfather came
from England," said Leonidas; "we all speak
English as well, or better, than you do in the
old country."</p>

<p>"I can't understand it!" said Lucy; "did
you come like other people, by the train, not
like the children in my dreams?"</p>

<p>And then Leonidas explained all about it to
her: how his father had brought him last year
to Europe and had put him to school at Paris;
but when the war broke out, and most of the
stranger scholars were taken away, no orders
came about him, because his father was a
merchant and was away from home, so that no
one ever knew whether the letters had reached
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>So Leonidas had gone on at school without
many tasks to learn, to be sure, but not very
comfortable: it was so cold, and there was no
wood to burn; and he disliked eating horses
and cats and rats, quite as much as Coralie did,
though he was not in a part of the town where
so many shells came in.</p>

<p>At last, when Lucy's uncle and some other
good gentlemen with the red cross on their
sleeves, obtained leave to go and take some
relief to the poor sick people in the hospitals,
the people Leonidas was with told them that
he was a little American left behind. Mr.
Seaman, which was Uncle Joe's name, went to
see about him, and found that he had once
known his father. So, after a great deal of
trouble, it had been managed that the boy
should be allowed to leave the town. He had
been driven in an omnibus, he told Lucy, with
some more Americans and English, and with flags
with stars and stripes or else Union Jacks all
over it; and whenever they came to a French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
sentry, or afterwards to a Prussian, they were
stopped till he called his corporal, who looked
at their papers and let them go on. Mr.
Seaman had taken charge of Leonidas, and
given him the best dinner he had eaten for a
long time, but as he was going to Blois to
other hospitals, he could not keep the boy
with him; so he had put him in charge of a
friend who was going to London, to send him
down to Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>Fear of Lucy's rash was pretty well over
now, and she was to go home in a day or two;
so the children were allowed to be together,
and they enjoyed it very much. Lucy told
about her dreams, and Leonidas had a good
deal to tell of what he had really seen on his
travels. They wished very much that they
could both see one of these wonderful dreams
together, only&mdash;what should it be?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE DREAM OF ALL NATIONS.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="296" height="400" alt="Oh! such a din!" title="Oh! such a din!" />
<span class="caption">Oh! such a din!</span>
<br /><div class='right'><i>Page 137.</i></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> should it be? She thought of Arabs
with their tents and horses, and Leonidas told
her of Red Indians with their war-paint, and
little Negroes dancing round the sugar-boiling,
till her head began quite to swim and her ears
to buzz; and all the children she had seen and
she had not seen seemed to come round her,
and join hands and dance. Oh, such a din!
A little Highlander in his tartans stood on a
whisky-barrel in the middle, making his bagpipes
squeal away; a Chinese with a bald head and
long pigtail beat a gong, and capered with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
solemn face; a Norwegian herd-boy blew a
monstrous bark cow-horn; an Indian juggler
twisted snakes round his neck to the sound of
the tom-tom; and Lucy found herself and
Leonidas whirling round with a young Dutch
planter between them, and an Indian with a
crown of feathers upon the other side of her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she seemed to herself to cry, "what
are you doing? how do you all come here?"</p>

<p>"We are from all the nations who are friends
and brethren," said the voices; "we all bring
our stores: the sugar, rice, and cotton of the
West; the silk and coffee and spices of the
East; the tea of China; the furs of the North:
it all is exchanged from one to the other, and
should teach us to be all brethren, since we
cannot thrive one without the other."</p>

<p>"It all comes to our country, because we are
clever to work it up, and send it out to be
used in its own homes," said the Highlander;
"it is English and Scotch machines that weave
your cottons, ay, and make your tools."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; it is America that beats you all," cried
Leonidas; "what had you to do, but to sit
down and starve, when we sent you no cotton?"</p>

<p>"If you send cotton, 'tis we that weave it,"
cried the Scot.</p>

<p>Lucy was almost afraid they would come to
blows over which was the greatest and most
skilful country. "It cannot be buying and selling
that make nations love one another, and
be peaceful," she thought. "Is it being learned
and wise?"</p>

<p>"But the Prussian boys are studious and
wise, and the French are clever and skilful,
and yet they have that dreadful war: I wonder
what it is that would make and keep all these
countries friends!"</p>

<p>And then there came an echo back to little
Lucy: "For out of Zion shall go forth the
Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
And He shall judge among the nations, and
shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
into pruning-hooks: nations shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they war any
more."</p>

<p>Yes; the more they learn and keep the law
of the Lord, the less there will be of those
wars. To heed the true law of the Lord will
do more for peace and oneness than all the
cleverness in book-learning, or all the skilful
manufactures in the world.</p>

Interpreting Some of the Common Forms of Vegetation. By
L. H. Bailey. 12mo. Illustrated. xxxi + 491 pages.</div>

<p>This volume is the outgrowth of "observation lessons." The
book is based upon the idea that the proper way to begin the study
of plants is by means of plants instead of formal ideals or definitions.
Instead of a definition as a model telling what is to be
seen, the plant shows what there is to be seen, and the definition
follows.<br /><br /><br /></p>
